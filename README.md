### Description
This repository is a summative assignment for the class DS105: Data for Data Science. 


Initially, my goal was to do an exploratory analysis of what defined "main pop girl" music - I wanted to get a list of top tracks by "main pop girls" such as Sabrina Carpenter, Chappel Roan, Olivia Rodrigo etc. and inspect their audio features. However, due to the deprecation of these endpoints in the Spotify API, I had to reformulate my research aim and question. 


### Research Question
What makes "main pop girl" music? What are its identifying qualities? How does it differ from other music (non-mainstream, non-pop, non-girl)?

### Aim

I will also aim to make predictions for two of the categories of the upcoming Grammy Music Awards

### Plan
1) Obtain top hits from 2000-2024
2) Obtain girly pop/"main pop girl" tracks
3) Combine these two playlists
4) Get top 5 female and male artists (decided through how many of their songs feature on the playlists)
5) Get these artists' top 10 tracks
6) Create a database of these songs
7) Get the lyrics to to these songs and put them in a database
8) Analyze these top 10 songs' lyrics to see whether they have any common themes or differences
