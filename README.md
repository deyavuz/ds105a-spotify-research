### Research Question
What makes "main pop girl" music? What are its identifying qualities? How does it differ from other music (non-mainstream, non-pop, non-girl)?

### Aim

I will also aim to make predictions for two of the categories of the upcoming Grammy Music Awards

### Plan
1) Obtain top hits from 2000-2024
2) Obtain female pop/"main pop girl" tracks
3) Get top 5 most frequent artist on both playlists
4) Get these artists' top 5 tracks
5) Create a database of these 20 songs
6) Get the lyrics to to these songs and put them in a database
7) Analyze these top 5 songs' lyrics to see whether they have any common themes
