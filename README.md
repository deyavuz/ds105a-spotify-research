Research Question
Does valence correlate with mean happiness in locations?

Aim
I want to see whether happy people listen to happy music! And explore 


Plan
1) Decide on which countries to investigate, based on happiness values (top 5, bottom 5, and median 5)
2) Retrieve featured playlists based on the spoken language in the selected countries
3) Retrieve the valence of every track in the dataset
4) Calculate average valence of every country and rank them from happiest to unhappiest, and then most valent to least valent
