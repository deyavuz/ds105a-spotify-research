and i'm on my way i still remember
these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hillembed"

she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said baby i just wanna dance

verse 
i met her on grafton street right outside of the bar
she shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
she asked me what does it mean the gaelic ink on your arm
said it was one of my friend's songs do you wanna drink on
she took jamie as a chaser jack for the fun
she got arthur on the table with johnny riding a shotgun
chatted some more one more drink at the bar
then put van on the jukebox got up to dance

chorus
you know she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said baby i just wanna dance
with my pretty little galway girl
you're my pretty little galway girl

verse 
you know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
and then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
as last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
after dancing the cili singing to trad tunes
i never heard carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
a cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
oh i could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
and in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

and now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
i was holding her hand her hand was holding mine
our coats both smell of smoke whisky and wine
as we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
i walked her home then she took me inside
to finish some doritos and another bottle of wine
i swear i'm gonna put you in a song that i write
about a galway girl and a perfect night

rap is a victorious genre having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hardknock lives in addition to observances of all of life's nuances rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched innercity beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

so it was fitting for billboard to create a chart in  dedicated to the thenrising genre birthed out of hiphop at the time mtv's influential yo mtv raps was only a few months old and acts like icet and nwa were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

while rap has evolved theres no denying its evergrowing power to celebrate the th anniversary of the billboards hot rap songs chart were counting down the top  songs in the tallys quartercentury history from saltnpepa to macklemore we've got the genre's past quartercentury covered

verse  flo rida
i know you wanna get behind the wheel but only one rida
eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
can't let go i got fans in okinawa
my heart to japan quake losers and survivors
norway no you didn't get my flowers
no way to say it better but the killer was a coward
face just showered the minute in a hour
heard about the news whole day went sour
bitter moments got me feeling like a lemonhead
put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
there go my regards but regardless i get arrested
ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
dui never said i was driving reckless
you and i know that jealously is not impressive

and i put that on my tattoo of jimi hendrix
get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket

sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
reality stressed when you're blessed just kill critics
bugatti never meant i'm rich just godfearing
look at me steering got the boss staring
got a good feeling mr mike caren
tell them billie jeans i'm on another planet

verse
how can i tell if i'm in the right relationship
aren't you really s'posed to know that shit
feel it in your bones and own that shit i don't know
then i had this interaction i've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks
wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling
wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me
wonder if he's judgin' me like i am right now

prechorus
i don't care
i'd rather tell the truth truth
than make it worse for you mm you

chorus
if the sun refused to shine
baby would i still be your lover
would you want me there
if the moon went dark tonight
and if it all ended tomorrow
would i be the one on your mind your mind your mind
and if it all ended tomorrow
would you be the one on mineyou might also likeembed"

but i knew you
dancin' in your levi's
drunk under a streetlight i
i knew you
hand under my sweatshirt
baby kiss it better i

refrain
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite

verse 
a friend to all is a friend to none
chase two girls lose the one
when you are young they assume you know nothing

but i knew you
playing hideandseek and
giving me your weekends i
i knew you
your heartbeat on the high line
once in twenty lifetimes i

refrain
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite

bridge
to kiss in cars and downtown bars
was all we needed
you drew stars around my scars
but now i'm bleedin'

chorus
'cause i knew you
steppin' on the last train
marked me like a bloodstain i
i knew you
tried to change the ending
peter losing wendy i
i knew you
leavin' like a father
running like water i
and when you are young they assume you know nothing
verse 
but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
i knew you'd haunt all of my whatifs
the smell of smoke would hang around this long
'cause i knew everything when i was young
i knew i'd curse you for the longest time
chasin' shadows in the grocery line
i knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
and you'd be standin' in my front porch light
and i knew you'd come back to me

Guilty as Sin?,Taylor Swift,1," lyricsverse 
drownin' in the blue nile
he sent me downtown lights

my boredom's bonedeep
this cage was once just fine
am i allowed to cry
i dream of crackin' locks
throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
crashin' into him tonight he's a paradox
i'm seeing visions
am i bad or mad or wise

chorus
what if he's written mine on my upper thigh only in my mind
one slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
oh what a way to die
i keep recalling things we never did
messy toplip kiss how i long for our trysts
without ever touchin' his skin
how can i be guilty as sin

verse 
i keep these longings lockd
in lowercase inside a vault
somone told me there's no such thing as bad thoughts
only your actions talk
these fatal fantasies
giving way to labored breath takin' all of me
we've already done it in my head
if it's makebelieve
why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow
