For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Sorry,Justin Bieber,0,"202 Lyrics[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life

Yeah, you got me singin' like

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (Oh, no)
And we'll say, ""Ooh, I love it when you do it like that""
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back, hey24Embed"
Thinking out Loud,Ed Sheeran,0,"197 Lyrics[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are876Embed"

Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me




So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas
We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful

And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone?

Bad Habits,Ed Sheeran,0,"148 Lyrics[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

I only know how to go too far

Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

And I know I lose control of the things that I say

And burned till the fun ran out, now

Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,0,"184 Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes

We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

Galway Girl,Ed Sheeran,0,"111 Lyrics[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

Lil bro you know I got you


I made my way from the bottom and I’m grindin’ (I’m grindin’)

Uh, everyday that I wake nigga, I’mma say my prayers (amen)
I’mma get on my grind dawg and my mama need a new crib (amen)
And I’mma make that shake, gotta put the food on they plate
Stay focused and get money, never gave a fuck what they say
Ain’t no time to sleep, I get guap
Ain’t no Jordan’s in the shoe box
Ain’t no roof that came with that drop
Chase that paper, youngin’ don’t stop
Nigga I was born and raised in that jungle
Tryna to get my folk and them out that struggle
Fuck that nine to five, it don’t cut
Ain’t no job I guess that’s my luck
Yeah, nigga outchea and that's every day
Tryna triple what I made today
This one here for my real niggas
And bad bitches who gettin’ cake
Count it up till your thumbs hurt
Put fam second and God first
Hatin’ niggas ain’t phasin’ me
You couldn’t walk a mile in my footwear

Uh, money over the best pussy
The blind hear me, the deaf lookin’
When opportunity knock, I ran out the back door
Shit I thought it was the cops, damn
I fuck the bitch with a broom stick
The same broom that I didn’t clean my room with
Stay on my toes, no ballet
Shout out my Zoe’s, Sak Pase
I’m twistin’ weed in my mansion
I go dumber than Lamont Sanford
Remember when moms couldn’t afford Pampers
Now she trying to avoid cameras
All I do is count my blessings, Weezy F for Fortunate
I came up from that bottom, now I’m richer than chocolate
Lil Tunechi

I made my way from the bottom, and I'm grindin'
I wake up every morning lookin' for commas
Bout my dollars; I'm goin' all out
And that's on my mama, on my mama (yeeeah)

I say another day, another dollar
Thank the Lord for my praying mama
Watch ya back in this cold world
Cause everybody won’t see tomorrow
Money called and I’m motivated
Kill the beat, it’s premeditated
Still remember like yesterday when them hard times had me frustrated
Say any day, I’mma go and get it
Pair of J’s and my Florida fitted
Quittin’ not in my vocab and no hate is found in my soul and spirit
Young nigga trying to feed the fam
Hatin’ on me, I don’t give a damn
Out here like what nigga?
You don’t get the picture like Instagram
Hundred dollars to a couple grand
Couple grand to a hundred bands
Hundred bands to them big Ms
And my weight up like six gyms
I’m outchea and I mean that
We The Best, where my team at?
Bad vibes, I don’t need that
I done came too far to be lookin’ back

I made my way from the bottom, and I'm grindin'
I wake up every morning lookin' for commas
Bout my dollars; I'm goin' all out
And that's on my mama, on my mama (yeeeah)


Yeahhhh
Cause we outchea (we outchea)

Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt

Life of the club arrogant like yeah
Talk like money so the girls just melt
One too many, all on me like twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standin' on chairs
Ball out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiculous
Zone out, so much attention
Scream out, I'm in the building, hey!

Now I got a word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun

No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

Champagne bucket still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket
Kleenex, get a call, just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the boss staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell them Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck and Lee Prince's parents
Buy my momma chandeliers, I'm in tears, dammit
Thirty years you'd have thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanished
No cheers, I know you woulda panicked

Yo' girl just kissed a girl, I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik, I'm throwin' these Emirates in the sky
Spendin' this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M-O-N-E-Y
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up 'cause I'm swole up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Bugatti for real, I'm cold, bruh

Got the key to my city, it's over

Sweet tooth, full of mama, like sugar to me

Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss
Won't smile this way, baby I rub it off
Put my tongue in your face
A little mistletoe, sippin' Grand Marnier I'm a fan all day
Do me that favor, 'cause I like your flavor
My manage behavior, I'm into your major
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player
My hood, now and later, throw back like a pager

Yeah
Hey, what are you hiding? (Watch)
What you doin' when you're gone? (Hey, hey)
Nothing wrong being private (watch)
Make sure it ain't wrong (yeah)
Your life double-sided (watch)
Two-faced like coins
What side do I get? (Watch)
What side are you on?
So what have you done? (Brrah)
Some of your dirt has come to light (yeah)
Why were you speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off? (Hey, hey)
And someone saw you in a fight
Am I right?
It doesn't matter to you if you get heads or tails
You just don't like to flip all the time
But if you spin it then you get to see both sides
Oh, the thrill of the double life
Lie detector time (watch)
Do you feel bad when you lie? (Watch)
The look on your face says the best life (watch)
And then come home like it's fine
Am I right? (Watch)
So what have you done?
Some of your dirt has come to light
Why were you speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off? (Hey)
And someone saw you in a fight
Am I right? (Ah)
It doesn't matter to you if you get heads or tails
You just don't like to flip all the time
But if you spin it then you get to see both sides
Oh, the thrill of the double life (brrah)
Who will you be tonight?
That's the question (brrah)
Who will Gru be tonight?
That's the question (yeah)
I know you heard the rumors (hey)
You must get over to it right away (oh)
If anyone can do it, you gotta get there soon, it's not okay (hey)
You got cars to drive, plenty jets to fly (baow, baow)
When will you arrive? You're running out of time
Don't you see that everything is on the line?
So I'm sorry but you have to choose a side
You'll never know when it's your time to go (side, hey)
And where you end up in life, that's code (side)
You can't ignore, you're spinning your life (baow, baow)
Your watch is broken 'cause you spent all your time (side)
It's now or never, on this, everything rides (side)
Before the spinning stops, you must pick a side (yeah, yeah, brrah)
Who will you be tonight?

Yeah, you never stayed in Kailua (Hawaii)
I put Chanel on my shooter (Yeah)
Flooded my chain and it's Gucci
I don't want that girl, she moody (Facts)
I'm basically saying I’m cooler (Slatt)
Get Dior discounts from my cougar
Back in the sixth grade, I got them bad grades
I was in love with my tutor (Yeah)
See, musically, Lil Uzi trappin’, man
Most of you rappers be actors, man
Go M.I.A when I find little Madison
Stay at the Ritz-Carlton, this not the Radisson
Just took a blue one, 'bout to take the red pill
Purple thoughts in my brain, hope it don’t spill
Stay with a nerd just like Urkel, Jaleel
Fresh just like Carlton, I kill 'em with Will
Big ass ""R"" on my Smiths
Big ass ""R"" on my whips
Slip-on shoes, so you won't trip
Said she kinda fine if she got some hips
Momma said, ""Let me see the witch
Boy, you know light and dark don't mix
Mix it up, boy, bad luck""
Sick to my stomach with them neon guts

Hella broads, hella broads
Yellow painting with a yellow brush
Shit came from KAWS, probably marge
Slick my hair back like I'm Chico DeBarge (Ayy)

Heard things ain't looking too good for you

We Found Love,Rihanna,1,"72 Lyrics[Video Intro: Agyness Deyn]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

[Verse 1]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage

If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would you be the one on mine?You might also like3Embed"

Elphie
Now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project

[ELPHABA, spoken]
Oh, you really don't have to do that

[GALINDA, spoken]
I know!
That's what makes me so nice

[GALINDA]
Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I
And let's face it, right? Who isn't less fortunate than I?
My tender heart tends to start to bleed
And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over
I know, I know exactly what they need
And even in your case
Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face
Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed
Follow my lead
And yes, indeed
You will be, ah

Popular
You're gonna be popular
I'll teach you the proper ploys when you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce, ooh!
I'll show you what shoes to wear, how to fix your hair
Everything that really counts to be popular
I'll help you be popular
You'll hang with the right cohorts, you'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know
So let's start 'cause you've got an awfully long way to go
You might also likeDon't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to become a pal
A sister and adviser, there's nobody wiser
Not when it comes to

Popular
I know about popular
And with an assist from me to be who you'll be
Instead of dreary who-you-were

[GALINDA, spoken]
Well, are!

[GALINDA]
There's nothing that can stop you from becoming populer… —lar!

La-la, la-la
We're gonna make you popular

When I see depressing creatures
With unprepossessing features
I remind them on their own behalf to think of
Celebrated heads of state
Or especially great communicators
Did they have brains or knowledge?
[GALINDA, spoken]
Don't make me laugh

[GALINDA]
They were

[ELPHABA, spoken]
Popular

[GALINDA, spoken]
Right!

[GALINDA]
It's all about popular
It's not about aptitude, it's the way you're viewed
So it's very shrewd to be
Very, very popular like me, me

And though you protest
Your disinterest
I know clandestinely
You're gonna grin and bear it, your newfound popularity (Woo!)
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la
La-la, ooh
You'll be popular
Just not quite as popular as me1Embed"

Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment

Completely focused, my mind is open

Skin to skin, oh my God

Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing

Fortnight (feat. Post Malone),Taylor Swift,1,"4 Lyrics[Lời bài hát ""Fortnight"" bởi Taylor Swift (feat. Post Malone)]

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Em đáng ra phải bị bắt đi rồi
Nhưng người ta đã quên đến đón em
Em là một con sâu rượu đang sống ổn thoả
Cho đến khi chẳng còn ai để ý đến gu thẩm mỹ mới của em nữa
Tất cả để nói rằng
Em mong anh vẫn ổn
Nhưng anh chính là lý do
Và chẳng ai trách gì đâu
Nhưng còn sự phản bội lặng thầm của anh thì sao?

[Điệp Khúc: Taylor Swift]
Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình bên nhau muôn đời
Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi vu vơ thời tiết
Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt
Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
Những sớm mai của em là những thứ Hai mắc kẹt trong một tháng 2 bất tận
Em đã uống thứ thuốc bước tiếp diệu kỳ, nhưng tác dụng chỉ là tạm thời thôi
Và em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em chạm vào anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần

Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

Guilty as Sin?,Taylor Swift,1,"193 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed his name
Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Bridge]
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

¿Qué pasa contigo? Dímelo
Rrr!
O-O-Ovy on the Drums! (Mmm)

[Verso 1: KAROL G]
Ya no tiene excusa (No, no)
Hoy salió con su amiga dizque pa' matar la tusa (Ah; tusa)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (Ah)
Está dura y abusa (Eh)
Se cansó de ser buena
Ahora es ella quien los usa (Hmm-mm)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (Mal)
Ya no se le ve sentimental (-tal)
Dice que por otro man no llora, no (Llora)

[Coro: KAROL G]
Pero si le ponen la canción (Hmm)
Le da una depresión tonta
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (-zón)
¿Será porque con otra está (Con otra está)
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?

Pero hice todo este llanto por nada
Ahora soy una chica mala
And now you kickin' and screamin', a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holla, holla (Holla)
Ayo (Kyuh!), I used to lay low (Uh-huh)
I wasn't in the clubs, I was on my J.O. (Oop!)
Until I realized you a epic fail, yo
So don't tell your guys that I'm still your bae, yo (Ah!)
'Cause it's a new day, I'm in a new place (Uh-huh)
Gettin' some new D, sittin' on a new face (Okay)
'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch that you ever really met (Oop!)
You searchin' for a badder bitch, and you ain't met her yet (Oop!)
Ayo, tell 'em to back off, he wanna slack off
Ain't no more booty calls, you gotta jack off
It's me and KAROL G, we let them racks talk
Don't run up on us, 'cause they lettin' the Makks off (Rrr!)

[Coro: KAROL G]
Pero si le ponen la canción (Hmm)
Le da una depresión tonta (Tonta)
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (No)
¿Será porque con otra está (Con otra está)
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?
Eh, ah
[Verso 3: KAROL G]
Un-un shot pa' la pena profunda (Un shot, eh)
Y seguimo' gastando la funda (La funda)
Otro shot pa' la mente (Yeah, yeah)
Pa' que el recuerdo no la atormente (Ah; oh)
Ya no le copia a nada (Na')
Su ex ya no vale nada (Nada)
Salió pa' la disco y solo quiere perrear (Perrear)
Pero se confunde cuando empieza a tomar (Tomar)

[Pre-Coro: KAROL G]
Ella se cura con rumba (Ah)
Y el amor pa' la tumba (Yeah)
To' los hombre' le zumban (Le zumban)

[Coro: KAROL G]
Pero si le ponen la canción (Oh)
Le da una depresión tonta (Tonta)
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (Oh)

Yo

[Verse 1]
Ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we 'bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes, though

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

My Only Wish (This Year),Britney Spears,1,"23 ContributorsMy Only Wish (This Year) Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this:
""I know exactly what I want this year""
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (Maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing:
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

Criminal,Britney Spears,1,"62 Lyrics[Verse 1]
He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Verse 2]
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh-oh, I know, oh
Should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay
He's with me
And I hear people talk (People talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care

'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
